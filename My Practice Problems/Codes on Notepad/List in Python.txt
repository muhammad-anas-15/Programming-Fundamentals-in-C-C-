List in Python:

                * Lists are just like dynamically sized arrays, but it canstore different size of datatypes like int, float ,strings etc.
                * In simple language, a list is a collection of things, enclosed in "[ ]" and separated by commas.
                * The list is a sequence data type which is used to store the collection of data. " Tuples " and  " String " are other types of sequence data types.



  a) Creating a list in Python:
 
           # Python program to demonstrate

          # Creating a List
             List = []
             print("Blank List: ")
             print(List)

          # Creating a List of numbers
            List = [10, 20, 14]
            print("\nList of numbers: ")
            print(List)

         # Creating a List of strings and accessing
         # using index

           List = ["Geeks", "For", "Geeks"]

           print("\nList Items: ")
           print(List[0])
           print(List[2])

 
  b) Creating a list with multiple distinct or duplicate elements:

        # Creating a List with  the use of Numbers
        # (Having duplicate values)

            List = [1, 2, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 6, 5]
            print("\nList with the use of Numbers: ")
            print(List)

       # Creating a List with mixed type of values
         # (Having numbers and strings)

          List = [1, 2, 'Geeks', 4, 'For', 6, 'Geeks']
          print("\nList with the use of Mixed Values: ")
           print(List)


      # Accessing elements from a multidimensional list

         # Creating a Multi-Dimensional List  (By Nesting a list inside a List)
             List = [['Geeks', 'For'], ['Geeks']]

        # accessing an element from the List using index number

            print("Accessing a element from a Multi-Dimensional list")
            print(List[0][1]) // For
            print(List[1][0]) //Geeks


  --> Negative indexing:
   
       * In Python, negative sequence indexes represent positions from the end of the List.
      * Negative indexing means beginning from the end, -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second-last item, etc.
      *  A list can be reversed by using the reverse().
      * Elements can be removed from the List by using the built-in remove().

  Example:

          List = [1, 2, 'Geeks', 4, 'For', 6, 'Geeks']

         # accessing an element using negative indexing
        # print the last element of list
             print(List[-1])// Geeks

       # print the third last element of list
          print(List[-3]) // For


 --> Getting the size of Python list:

    * Python len() is used to get the length of the list.

--> Taking slices out of List:

    * Copying consecutive elements from one List to another.
    * There is range of indexes showing start end of list to copied.
    * If ending range is empty it will copy till end.   like Index[0: ]
      
  Syntax:
                new_list  = existing_list [index(first) : index(last)]


 --> pop() method:

       * Used to remove and return an element from the list, 
       * By default it removes only the last element of the list, 
        * To remove an element from a specific position of the List, the index of the element is passed as an argument to the pop() method.


   Example:
                     List = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

                   # Removing element from the
                   # Set using the pop() method
                      List.pop()
                     print("\nList after popping an element: ")
                     print(List)

                 # Removing element at a specific location from the Set using the pop() method
                    List.pop(2)
                    print("\nList after popping a specific element: ")
                    print(List)
