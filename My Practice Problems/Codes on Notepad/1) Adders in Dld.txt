           "An adder is a digital logic circuit in electronics that is extensively used for the addition of numbers."

   a) Half Adder: (2 bit system, 4 combinations)
                 The half adder circuit has two inputs: A and B, which add two input digits and generates two Outputs
                    i) carry     ii) sum.

      Logic Diagram:
                    To perform the sum operation, XOR is applied to both the inputs, --> Sum= A XOR B
                    and AND gate is applied to both inputs to produce carry.         --> Carry = A AND B

      Boolean Expression:

      1) Sum(S) = A'B + AB'/(A⊕B)--> the sum output is 1 only if the input variables, A and B, are not equal, can be expressed as the exclusive-OR of  A,B.
      2) Carry(Cout) = A.B --> the output carry (Cout) is 1 only when both inputs are 1s,therefore, Cout can be expressed as the AND of A and B.

                       A           B                               Sum          Carry

     b) Full Adder: (3 bit system, 9 combinations)
                   The full-adder has three inputs, first two inputs are A and B and the third input is an input carry as C-IN and two outputs Sum and  
                   Carry, whereas half adder has only two inputs and two outputs.

     Logic Diagram:
                   To perform the sum operation, XOR is applied to three inputs, --> Sum = A XOR B XOR Cin.

     Boolean Expression:
                 
            1) Sum is  S = (A⊕B⊕Cin) 
            2) Carry is Cout = AB + (A ⊕ B)Cin   --> two half-adders, connected
