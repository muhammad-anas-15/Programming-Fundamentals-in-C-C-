Flip Flops:
           --> The flip-flop is a circuit that maintains a state until directed by input to change the state. 
           --> Flip-flop is popularly known as the basic digital memory circuit.
           --> It has its two states as logic 1(High) and logic 0(low) states.
           --> A flip flop is a sequential circuit which consist of single binary state of information or data.
