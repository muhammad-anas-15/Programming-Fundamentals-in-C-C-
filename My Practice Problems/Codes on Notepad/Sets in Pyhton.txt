Sets in Pyhton:

      * Python Set is an unordered collection of data types that is iterable, mutable, and has no duplicate elements.
      * The order of elements in a set is undefined though it may consist of various elements.
      * A Python set cannot have mutable elements like a list or dictionary, as it is immutable. 
      * The major advantage of using a set, as opposed to a list, is that it has a highly optimized method for checking whether a specific element is contained in the set.


Creating a Set in Python:
 
     * Python Sets can be created by using the built-in   "set()"    function with an iterable object or a sequence by placing the sequence inside curly braces, separated by a ‘comma’.
     * A set is created by using curly braces {} notation, containing the number 1,2 and 3.

                               # Another Method to create sets in Python3 Set containing numbers
                                                my_set = {1, 2, 3}
                                                print(my_set)

Adding Elements to a Set in Python

                             Using add() Method
                             Using update() Method

        * Only one element at a time can be added to the set by using add() method, loops are used to add multiple elements at a time with the use of add() method.
        *  Lists cannot be added to a set as elements because Lists are not hashable whereas Tuples can be added because tuples are immutable and hence Hashable. 

 Exampe 1:

        # Creating a Set
          set1 = set()
          print("Initial blank Set: ")
          print(set1)

      # Adding element and tuple to the Set
       set1.add(8)
       set1.add(9)
       set1.add((6, 7))
       print("\nSet after Addition of Three elements: ")
      print(set1)

    # Adding elements to the Set using Iterator

       for i in range(1, 6):
             set1.add(i)
            print("\nSet after Addition of elements from 1-5: ")
            print(set1)

Output:

       Initial blank Set: 
      set()

       Set after Addition of Three elements: 
      {8, 9, (6, 7)}

       Set after Addition of elements from 1-5: 
       {1, 2, 3, (6, 7), 4, 5, 8, 9}
