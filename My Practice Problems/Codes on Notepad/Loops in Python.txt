Loops in Python:
 
1) For Loop:

    --> Syntax:
                                    for variable_name("i")  in range(value till loop executes) :
                                                 // statements

Example 1:
                      
           * The loop assigns each character to the variable i and continues until all characters in the string have been processed.
      
            # Iterating over a String
                print("String Iteration")
                s = "Geeks"

                 for i in s:
                       print(i)


           Output:
                           G
                           e
                           e
                           k
                           s

--> Python for loop with Range:
 
         * This code uses a Python for loop with index in conjunction with the range() function to generate a sequence of numbers starting from 0, up to (but not including) 10.

             for i in range(0, 10):
                        print(i)


--> Python for loop Enumerate:
  
       * The enumerate() function is used with the for loop to iterate over an iterable while also keeping track of the index of each item.

           l1 = ["eat", "sleep", "repeat"]

           for count, ele in enumerate(l1):
                  print (count, ele)

--> Nested For Loops in Python:

         for i in range(1, 4):
               for j in range(1, 4):
                      print(i, j)



--> Python For Loop Over List;

         # Python program to illustrate Iterating over a list
              l = ["geeks", "for", "geeks"]

                  for i in l:
                       print(i)


--> Python For Loop with Dictionary:
 
        # Iterating over dictionary
           print("Dictionary Iteration")
           d = dict()

          d['xyz'] = 123
          d['abc'] = 345

         for i in d:
            print("% s % d" % (i, d[i]))

     Output:

          Dictionary Iteration
         xyz  123
         abc  345


--> Python For Loop with Tuple:

      t = ((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6))
      for a, b in t:
            print(a, b)


--> Python for loop in One Line:

      Numbers =[x for x in range(11)]
          print(Numbers)



2) While Loop:

   * The main difference between Python "for-Loop" and  "while-loop" is that  for loop is usually used when the "number of iterations" is 'known', whereas Python while loop is used 
      when the number of iterations is 'unknown'.

Example:
        
               # Python program to illustrate while loop     
                  count = 0

              while (count < 3): 
	             count = count + 1
	             print("Hello Geek")
