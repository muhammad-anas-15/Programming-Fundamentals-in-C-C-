Inheritance in C++:

  * Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP), including C++. 
    It allows a class to inherit properties (data members and member functions) from another class, called the base class or parent class. 

 * It helps in reusability of code, we can reuse class and add additional features to it, reusing class save money and time.
   Reusing already tested and debugged class will save a lot of effort of developing and debugging the same thing again. 
   
What is inheritance in C++:

   • The concept of reusability in C++ is supported through inheritance.
   • We can use the properties of existing class by inheriting from it.
   • The existing class is called "Base class" / "Parent class" / "Super class".
   • The new class which is inherited is called "Derived Class" / "Child class" / "Sub class".

Types of Inheritance:

 1) Single Inheritance
 2) Multilevel Inheritance
 3) Multiple Inheritance
 4) Hierarchical Inheritance
 5) Hybrid Inheritance


1) Single Inheritance:
  
  • When there is 1 base class and 1 derived class. 
                      class A -------> class B
         ( Base )        ( Derived ) 
   arrow inticates that 'B' is derived from 'A' 

Example :
        
                                                                              // Derived class inheriting from Shape
class Shape {                                                                    class Rectangle : public Shape {
protected:                                                                       public:
    int width;                                                                   Rectangle(int w, int h) : Shape(w, h) {}
    int height;                                                                  int area() {
                                                                                 return width * height;
public:
    Shape(int w, int h) : width(w), height(h) {}                                 }
                                                                                  };
    void setWidth(int w) {
        width = w;
    }

    void setHeight(int h) {
        height = h;
    }
};

int main() {
    Rectangle rect(5, 4);
    std::cout << "Area of rectangle: " << rect.area() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
