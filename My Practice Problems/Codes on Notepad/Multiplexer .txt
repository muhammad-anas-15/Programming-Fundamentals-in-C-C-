Multiplexer: 
            1) The multiplexer is a device that has multiple inputs and single line output. 
            2) The select lines determine which input is connected to the output, and also increase the amount of data that can be sent over a network 
               within a certain time.
            3) It is also called a data selector.
            4) It has 2^n input lines and single output.

Example:
           
         The single-pole multi-position switch is a simple example of a non-electronic circuit of the multiplexer, and it is widely used in 
         many electronic circuits. The multiplexer is used to perform high-speed switching and is constructed by electronic components.

Multiplexer Types:
                  2-1 multiplexer ( 1select line)
                  4-1 multiplexer (2 select lines)
                  8-1 multiplexer(3 select lines)
                  16-1 multiplexer (4 select lines)


1) 4-to-1 Multiplexer:
 
                      The 4 X 1 multiplexer comprises 4-input bits, 1- output bit, and 2- select lines. The four input bits are namely Do, D1, D2, and D3.

 Truth Table:
                         Selection Lines                   Output 
                        S1         So                        Y
                         0          0                        Io
                         0          1                        I1
                         1          0                        I2
                         1          1                        I3

Boolean Expression:
                           Y = S1'So'Io + S1'SoI1 + S1So'I2 + S1SoI3 
        

2) 8-to-1 Multiplexer:
 
                      The 8-to-1 multiplexer consists of 8 input lines, one output line, and 3 selection lines.
