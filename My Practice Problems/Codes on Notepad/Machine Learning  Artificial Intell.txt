Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence :

                   Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science focused on building 
                   computer systems that learn from data, it focuses on using data and algorithms to enable AI to imitate the
                   way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

                   Machine learning algorithms are trained to find relationships and patterns in data. In simpler terms, machine 
                   learning enables computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed
                   to do so.

                   They use historical data as input to make predictions, classify information, cluster data points, reduce
                   dimensionality and even help generate new content, as demonstrated by new ML-fueled applications such as 
                   ChatGPT, Dall-E 2 and GitHub Copilot.

        " In traditional programming, a computer follows a set of predefined instructions to perform a task. However, in machine learning, 
          the computer is given a set of examples (data) and a task to perform, but it's up to the computer to figure out how to accomplish
          the task based on the examples it's given."
                       
                   For instance, if we want a computer to recognize images of cats, we don't provide it with specific instructions on
                   what a cat looks like. Instead, we give it thousands of images of cats and let the machine learning algorithm figure
                   out the common patterns and features that define a cat. Over time, as the algorithm processes more images, it gets 
                   better at recognizing cats, even when presented with images it has never seen before.


Q) Why Should We Learn Machine Learning?

                 " Machine learning is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide range of problems. It allows computers 
                   to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed. This makes it possible to build systems that can 
                   automatically improve their performance over time by learning from their experiences. "

There are many reasons why learning machine learning is important:

1)  Machine learning is widely used in many industries, including healthcare, finance, and e-commerce. By learning machine learning, 
    you can open up a wide range of career opportunities in these fields.

2)  Machine learning can be used to build intelligent systems that can make decisions and predictions based on data. This can help 
    organizations make better decisions, improve their operations, and create new products and services.

3)  Machine learning is an important tool for data analysis and visualization. It allows you to extract insights and patterns from 
    large datasets, which can be used to understand complex systems and make informed decisions.
