                 "The binary digits subtraction can be done with the help of the subtractor circuit. This is one kind of combinational 
                  logic circuit, used to perform the subtraction of two binary digits like 0s and 1s. Subtraction of binary digits from 0 to 0
                  or 0 to 1 does not alter the result, subtraction of 1 to 1 will result as 0 but the subtraction of 1 to 0 needs borrow."


   a) Half Subtracter: (2 bit system, 4 combinations)
                 The half subtracter circuit has two inputs: A and B, which add two input digits and generates two Outputs
                    i) carry     ii) difference.

      Logic Diagram:
                    To perform the difference operation, XOR is applied to both the inputs, --> Sum= A XOR B
                    and AND gate is applied to both inputs to produce carry.         --> Carry = A AND B

      Boolean Expression:

      1) Difference(D) = A'B + AB'/(A⊕B)--> the sum output is 1 only if the input variables, A and B, are not equal, can be expressed as the exclusive-OR of A,B.
      2) Carry(Cout/Borrow) = A'.B --> the output carry (Cout) is 1 only when A is 0s & B is 1's,therefore, Cout can be expressed as the AND of A and B.

     b) Full Adder: (3 bit system, 9 combinations)
                   The full-subtracter has three inputs, first two inputs are A and B and the third input is an input carry as B-IN and two outputs Diff  
                   and Borrow, whereas half subtacter has only two inputs and two outputs.  

     Logic Diagram:
                   To perform the sum operation, XOR is applied to three inputs, --> Sum = A XOR B XOR Cin.

     Boolean Expression:
                 
            1) Diff is  S = (A⊕B⊕Bin) 
            2) Carry is Cout = A'(B ⊕ C)Cin   --> or  A'Bin + A'B + B Bin
