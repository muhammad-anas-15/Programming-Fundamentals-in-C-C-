Encoders: 

         1) It is combinational logic circuit.
         2) It performs reverse operation of decoder.
         3) Encoder is used to convert an active input signal into coded output signal.
         4) Encoder has ‘M’ input lines, only one of which is activated at given time,produces an 'N' Bit output cod, depending on which input is
            activated. 
         5) Difference between Encoder and Decoder is that Decoder has 'binary code' as an input while Encoder has binary code as output          



Applications of Encoder:
      
        1) Decimal to BCD Encoder
        2) Octal to Binary Encoder.
        3) Hexadecimal to Binary Encoder.
