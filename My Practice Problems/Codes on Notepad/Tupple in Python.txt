Tupple in Python:

    * Tuple is a collection of Python Programming objects much like a list.
    * The sequence of values stored in a tuple can be of any type, and they are indexed by integers.
    *  Values of a tuple are syntactically separated by ‘commas‘ with or without the use of parentheses for grouping the data sequence.
    * Tuples can also be created with a single element, but it is a bit tricky.
        Having one element in the parentheses is not sufficient, there must be a trailing ‘comma’ to make it a tuple. 
 --> Creation of Python tuple without the use of parentheses is known as Tuple Packing.  

1) Creation of a Tupple:

     # Creating an empty Tuple
        Tuple1 = ()
        print("Initial empty Tuple: ")
        print(Tuple1)

    # Creating a Tuple with the use of string
       Tuple1 = ('Geeks', 'For')
        print("\nTuple with the use of String: ")
        print(Tuple1)

   # Creating a Tuple with the use of list
      list1 = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
     print("\nTuple using List: ")
     print(tuple(list1))

    # Creating a Tuple with the use of built-in function
      Tuple1 = tuple('Geeks')
      print("\nTuple with the use of function: ")
      print(Tuple1)


2) Creating a Tuple with Mixed Datatypes:

     # Creating a Tuple with Mixed Datatype
        Tuple1 = (5, 'Welcome', 7, 'Geeks')
        print(Tuple1)

     # Creating a Tuple with nested tuples
       Tuple1 = (0, 1, 2, 3)
       Tuple2 = ('python', 'geek')
       Tuple3 = (Tuple1, Tuple2)
       print(Tuple3)

     # Creating a Tuplewith repetition
       Tuple1 = ('Geeks',) * 3
        print(Tuple1)

# Creating a Tuple with the use of loop
      Tuple1 = ('Geeks')
       n = 5
 print("\nTuple with a loop")
   for i in range(int(n)):
        Tuple1 = (Tuple1,)
        print(Tuple1)

  
 --> Python Tuple Operations
      Here, below are the Python tuple operations.

              1) Accessing of Python Tuples
              2) Concatenation of Tuples  (using '+')
              3) Slicing of Tuple
              4) Deleting a Tuple (using 'del')
