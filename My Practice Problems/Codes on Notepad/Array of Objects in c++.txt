Array of Object:

 * There are 2 concepts      1) Object of Arrays                     2) Array of Object

1) Object of Arrays:

 * Simply if you have a data member array in class and then you create object of class then object contain array is called object of array:
 
                 class data{
                                int array[10];

                       };
                              data d1; // d1 contain array[10] of 10 integers.     d1{ array[10]}

 * Stores multiple arrays as properties within a single object.
 * Each array holds a collection of related items.
 * Access arrays using property names on the object and then access elements within the arrays using their index.

 * Use an object of arrays when you have multiple, categorized lists.
   Example: 
         User preferences storing favorite colors and fruits.
  
          const data = {
                       colors: ["red", "green", "blue"],
                       fruits: ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
                       };
   
                        console.log(data.colors[2]); // Outputs "blue"


2) Array of Objects:
 
* Simply object is itself an array .  // d1[10]. 
* Stores multiple objects within a single array.
* Each object represents a distinct entity with its own properties (key-value pairs).
* Access elements using their index within the array and then access object properties using dot notation or bracket notation.

* Use an array of objects when you have a collection of items with unique properties.
  Example: 
          A list of students with information like name, age, and grades.

          const students = [
                         { name: "Alice", age: 20 },
                         { name: "Bob", age: 22 },
                         { name: "Charlie", age: 18 }
                           ];

                           console.log(students[1].name); // Outputs "Bob"
