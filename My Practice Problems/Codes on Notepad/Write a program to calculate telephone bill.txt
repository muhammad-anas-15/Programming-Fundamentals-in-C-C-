Write a program that prompts the user to input number of calls and calculate the monthly telephone bills as per the following rule:

Minimum Rs. 200 for up to 100 calls.
Plus Rs. 0.60 per call for next 50 calls.
Plus Rs. 0.50 per call for next 50 calls.
Plus Rs. 0.40 per call for any call beyond 200 calls.


Code:

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
int number_of_calls;
printf("Enter no of calls:");
scanf("%d",&number_of_calls);

if (number_of_calls == 100){
float amount;
amount =200;
printf("Amount for 100 call is =%f",amount);}

if (number_of_calls == 150){
float amount;
amount = 200 +(50*0.6);
printf("Amount for additional 50 call is =%f",amount);}

if (number_of_calls == 200){
float amount;
amount = 200 +(50*0.6) + (50*0.50);
printf("Amount for additional 50 call is =%f",amount);}

if (number_of_calls >200){
float amount;
amount = 200 +(50*0.6) + (50*0.50) + 0.40 ;
printf("Amount for calls geater than 200 is =%f",amount);}

else
{return 0;}}
