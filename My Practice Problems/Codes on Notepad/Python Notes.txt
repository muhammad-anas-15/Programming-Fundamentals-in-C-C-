Python Notes:

Loops in Python:

  1) for 
  2) while

For loop:
         A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence such as a list, tuple, or string.
         Use when you exactly know how many times you want to execute the loop.


Example:

   colors = ["Blue", "Black", "Green", "Grey"]
   
   for i in colors: // in means 'include'  
         print(i)
      or

   for i in range(1,4):
         print(i)
