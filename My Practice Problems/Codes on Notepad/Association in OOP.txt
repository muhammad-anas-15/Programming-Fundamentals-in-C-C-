Association:
        
   * It is a "HAS-A" relationship.
   
   * It is a relationship between two separate classes which establishes through their objects
   
   * class --> another class
  
   * Create a new class composed of existing class.

   * Members are accessible by the use of reference (pointer) 

   * We can use "this" pointer which point to current class members. 

   * Association is a relationship between two classes that defines a   connection or a link between them.

   * The association can be bi-directional, meaning that both classes can use each otherâ€™s methods and properties.

   * The relationship can be of any type, such as a one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.

   * For example, a Customer class might be associated with an Order class, where each customer can have multiple orders.

   * Association is a simple structural connection or channel between classes and is-a relationship where all objects have their
     own lifecycle and there is no ownwer.

Example:
        Multiple Patients can associate with a single doctor and single patient can associate with multiple doctors, but there is 
        no ownership between the objects and both have their own lifecycle. Both can create and delete independently .


One to one Association:
    
    * In one-to-one association only one object is associated with other object at a time.
  
    * The mulitiplicity symbol "1" is written at the end of the link to represent that there is only one object present in communication.

    * A line without multilicity indicates one-to-one association

Examples:
        1) Employee(1) --- has ---> (1)Emp-code
        
        2) State --------------------- City   //  class diagram shows association b/w classes
           Name    --- Has-Capital --- Name 

        3) State --------------------- City  //   association b/w objects
           US  ------ Has-Capital ---  chicago 

     Note: Example program in dev. 


One to many association:

     * One object is associated with one or more objects at a time

Examples:
     
        1) Customer(1) ---- has ---- (*)Accounts // "*" shows many association means 1 customer has many accounts

        2) Customer ---- has ---- Account(A) // instant objects
            (Ali)   ---- has ---- Account(B) // links b/w objects

       
Many to one association:

      * Many objects are associated with one or more objects at a time

Example:

          Person (*)--- works_for --- Company
            Name                        Name
            id                          Address

Many to many association:

       * Many objects are associated with one or more objects at a time.

Example:
        
         Customer(*) ---- Purchases ----(*) Products
          Name                         Name
