Composition:

    * This process of building complex objects from simpler ones is called  object composition.

    * In object-oriented programming languages, object composition is used for objects that have a

    * Strong “has-a” relationship with each other. 
 
    * Therefore, the complex object is called the "whole" or a 'parent object' whereas a 'simpler object' is often referred to as a "Part" or 'child object'.

Syntax:
    
      class A // Part or Child class or composing class
            {
              // body of a class
            };

     class B // whole or Parent class or composed class
       {
         A objA;
         public:
             B(arg-list) : objA(arg-list1);
        };
