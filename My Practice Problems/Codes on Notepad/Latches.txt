Latches:
       --> Latches are digital circuits that store a single bit of information and hold its value until it is updated by new input signals. 
       --> They are used in digital systems as temporary storage elements to store binary information.
       --> One can use it to store either 0 or 1 at a specified time.
       --> A latch contains two inputs- SET and RESET, and it also has two outputs. They complement each other.
       --> One can use a latch for storing one bit of data. 
       --> These are sensitive to the input voltage applied and does not depend on the clock pulse. 

Gates Used:
           Latches can be implemented using various digital logic gates, such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, and NOR gates.

Applications:
             Latches are widely used in digital systems for various applications, including data storage, control circuits, and flip-flop
             circuits. They are often used in combination with other digital circuits to implement sequential circuits, such as state machines
             and memory elements.
