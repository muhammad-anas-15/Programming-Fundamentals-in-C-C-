Exception Handling in C++ :

 *** An exception is an unexpected problem that arises during the execution of a program our program terminates suddenly with 
     some errors/issues. Exception occurs during the running of the program (runtime).

C++ try and catch:
                  try {         
                     // Code that might throw an exception
                      throw SomeExceptionType("Error message");
                      } 

                  catch( ExceptionName e1 )  
                    {   
                     // catch block catches the exception that is thrown from try block
                   }

1. try in C++:

The try keyword represents a block of code that may throw an exception placed inside the try block. Itâ€™s followed by one or more catch blocks. If an exception occurs, try block throws that exception.

2. catch in C++:

The catch statement represents a block of code that is executed when a particular exception is thrown from the try block. The code to handle the exception is written inside the catch block.

3. throw in C++:

An exception in C++ can be thrown using the throw keyword. When a program encounters a throw statement, then it immediately terminates the current function and starts finding a matching catch block to handle the thrown exception. 

The try and catch keywords come in pairs: We use the try block to test some code and If the code throws an exception we will handle it in our catch block.
