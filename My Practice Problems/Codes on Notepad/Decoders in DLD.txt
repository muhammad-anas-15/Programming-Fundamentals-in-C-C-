Decoders: 

         1) It is multiple input and multiple Output Device, that converts coded input into decoded output
         2) Decoder is used to convert code in to set of signals.
         3) Decoder is a combinational circuit that has ‘n’ input lines and maximum of 2n output lines. 
         4) A decoder is a logic circuit that accepts a set of inputs that represents a binary number and activates only the output 
            that corresponds to the input number.
         5) In other words, a decoder circuit look at its inputs, determines which binary number is present there, and activates the one output that	   
            corresponds to the number, all other outputs remain inactive.

         6) An AND gate can be used as the basic decoding element because it produces a high output only when all inputs are high.

         if 2 inputs --> 2^2 = 4 outputs
         if 3 inputs --> 2^3 = 8 outputs


          One of these outputs will be active
          High based on the combination of inputs present, when the decoder is enabled. That means decoder detects a particular code. 
          The outputs of the decoder are nothing but the min terms of ‘n’ input variables lines, when it is enabled.

Applications of Decoder:
      
        1) Binary to Octal           3  8
        2) Binary to Hexadecimal     4  16
        3) Binary to Decimal

                       A           B                               Do     D1     D2     D3
