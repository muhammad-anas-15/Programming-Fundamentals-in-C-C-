Lines in 3D space.

***Equation of line and Vector Parallel to it***

1) Find vector,parametric,symmetric equation for the line passes through the point (x,y,z) and parallel to vector ai-2j+5k.

In such questions we have some points and a vector .
If we have two points Po(xo,yo,zo) P(x1,y1,z1) first we find V=P1-Po and for ro we take first point Po.

Sol:
   * A Line is define by two things. 1)We need point on a line. 2)Direction of a Line.

***Vector Equqtion: 
    r =ro + a  : a = tv          normal vector(r) = sum of both vectors or it's vector sum by head to tail rule. 
       ro = <Xo,Yo,Zo>     :  v (a,b,c)  : ro is a position vector

***Parametric Equation:
                             x = x0 +at,   y = yo+bt,   z = zo+ct

***Symmetric Equations:
                             x - xo /a = y - yo/b = z -zo/c


***Equation of line and Vector Perpendicular to it***

In case of point lie on a plane and a vector perpendicular to it. first we draw a normal vector(ro) for origin O to that point. now draw another vecor(r) from origin. now (ro-r) is equal to another vector which is perperndicular to normal vector(n).
                    n . (r-ro) = 0 ---> eq (i)
               n = <a,b,c> , r =(x,y,z) ----> P   , ro = (xo,yo,zo) -----> Po   put these values in equation (i)
      so,    
              a(x-xo)+b(y-yo)+c(z-zo)  = 0      Equation of a plane given a point and perpendicular normal vector
                 ax + by + cz +d =0     ------> Equation of linear equation in three variables a,b,c represent a plane   






***Skew Lines***

If we have parametric equations of two line segment L1 & L2 and we have to find that they are skew line?
So first we compare t values of l1 as t(x,y,z)   and s  s(x,y,z) and put these values of x,y,z in both lines segment and compare values of 't' and 's' if they are equal than they are skew lines or else not.


***Equation of a Plane Given Three Points***
1) First we have to find normal vector(n) which is perpendicular to plane and then put variables of A(x,y,z) in n.
    for this we take 3 points as A , B , C
    now distance between these points as distance between A&B is equal to vector 'a'. distance between A&C is equal to vector 'b'. 
    cross product of a×b=n gives us normal vector  n(a,b,c).
    put all these values in equation:
                                      a(x-xo)+b(y-yo)+c(z-zo)  = 0



***Point at which the line with parametric equations intersect the plane ax+by+cz=d***
1) Put all parametric equations in plane and we get value of 't'.
2) Put this value of t in all parametric equations.
3) We get point of intersection(x,y,z).



***Angle between two planes***
1) Plane 1 normal vector(n1),Plane 2 normal vector(n2).
2) n1(x1,y1,z1)---> Plane1
3) n2(x2,y2,z2)---> Plane2
4) First we have two find angle between normal vectors :
                                                        cosθ = n1 .n2 / |n1| |n2|
so n1.n2 = x1(x2)+y1(y2)+z1(z2)
  |n1| = √ (x1)^2 +(y1)^2 +(z1)^2
  |n2| = √ (x2)^2 +(y2)^2 +(z2)^2
